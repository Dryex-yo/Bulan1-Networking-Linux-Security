MINI PENTEST REPORT – WEEK 4
Name: Dryex
Environment: Kali Linux Lab
============================================================

TARGETS:
1. TryHackMe Lab (VPN Environment)
2. OverTheWire – Bandit Level 0–10
3. Metasploitable 2 (192.168.100.30)

Methodology: Blackbox Testing


SECTION 1 – EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

During Week 4, a mini penetration testing simulation was conducted
to practice reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, and documentation.

Key Findings:
- Multiple open services detected on target machine
- Telnet service enabled
- Default credentials in use
- Root access obtained without complex exploitation

Risk Level (Lab Environment): HIGH


SECTION 2 – RECONNAISSANCE
============================================================

Command Used:
nmap -sC -sV -p- 192.168.100.30

Open Ports Discovered:
21   FTP
22   SSH
23   Telnet
80   HTTP
139  NetBIOS
445  SMB
3306 MySQL

Conclusion:
Target has a large attack surface due to multiple open services.


SECTION 3 – EXPLOITATION (TELNET)
============================================================

Service: Telnet (Port 23)

Command:
telnet 192.168.100.30

Credentials Used:
Username: msfadmin
Password: msfadmin

Result:
Access Granted
whoami → root
id → uid=0(root)

Conclusion:
Root access obtained due to:
- Telnet enabled
- Default credentials
- No access restriction


SECTION 4 – POST-EXPLOITATION
============================================================

User Enumeration:
cat /etc/passwd

Password Hash Access:
cat /etc/shadow

Check Active Services:
netstat -tulpn

Search Configuration Files:
find / -name "*.conf" 2>/dev/null

Search SUID Binaries:
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

Purpose:
Identify persistence possibilities and privilege escalation paths.


SECTION 5 – SECURITY ANALYSIS
============================================================

Vulnerabilities Identified:

1. Telnet enabled (unencrypted protocol)
2. Default credentials in use
3. Excessive open ports
4. No firewall restrictions

Security Risks:
- Credential sniffing
- Immediate root access
- Lateral movement possibility
- Full system compromise


SECTION 6 – RECOMMENDATIONS
============================================================

1. Disable Telnet service
2. Use SSH with key-based authentication
3. Change all default passwords
4. Implement firewall rules
5. Close unnecessary ports
6. Keep system updated and patched


SECTION 7 – OVERTHEWIRE BANDIT 0–10 SUMMARY
============================================================

Skills Acquired:

Level 0  : SSH login
Level 1  : Special filename handling ("-")
Level 2  : Filename with spaces and "--"
Level 3  : Hidden file discovery
Level 4  : File type identification
Level 5  : Basic file search (find)
Level 6  : Advanced file search (metadata filtering)
Level 7  : Text searching (grep)
Level 8  : Data filtering (sort + uniq)
Level 9  : Extract readable strings from binary
Level 10 : Base64 decoding

Mindset Developed:
- Use the right tool for the problem
- Filter data efficiently
- Enumeration is critical
- Linux is a toolbox


SECTION 8 – TRYHACKME NETWORKING CONCEPTS
============================================================

Concepts Understood:

- TCP vs UDP
- 3-way handshake
- TCP SYN scan
- Port states (open, closed, filtered)
- Service fingerprinting


FINAL CONCLUSION
============================================================

The mini pentest simulation demonstrated that successful exploitation
often occurs due to weak configuration rather than complex hacking techniques.

Main Takeaways:
- Enumeration is the most important phase
- Default credentials are critical risks
- Misconfiguration leads to full compromise
- Proper documentation is essential in penetration testing
